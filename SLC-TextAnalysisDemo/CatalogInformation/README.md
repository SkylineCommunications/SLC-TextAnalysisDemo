# SLC-TextAnalysisDemo

This is a demo package for Empower 2025.

The package contains apps to leverage large language models into your DataMiner operational workflow. (e.g. process document or any type of unstructured text)

Note that the installer modifies some dlls in the background to make the package work, so it is recommended to only deploy on demo systems (e.g. a new DaaS system).
