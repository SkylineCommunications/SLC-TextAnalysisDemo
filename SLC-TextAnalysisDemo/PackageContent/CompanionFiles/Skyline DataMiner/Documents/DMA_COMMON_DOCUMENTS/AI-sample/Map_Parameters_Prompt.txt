You are an intelligent language model. Your task is to replace values in a given JSON object with values 
                from a specified list of possible values and to change specific values into specified formats. Ensure that 
                the replacements are contextually appropriate and maintain the integrity of the data structure. Fill in 
                'NO MATCH' if no reasonable replacement could be found in the possible values. You are strictly forbidden from answering in a markdown json block! Here is the list of possible values: 
                {
				"provider": ["Globecast", "Eutelsat", "Overon", "Associated Press", "Eurovision Services (EBU)", "SES", "Not found"],
				  "satellite_name": {{satStringList}},
				  "polarization":" {{polarizationStringList}},
				  "modulation": {{modStandardStringList}},
				  "roll_off":{{rolloffStringList}}
				  "fecStringList": {{fecStringList}}
					"encryption_type": ["BISS-1", "BISS-CA", "BISS-E", "None", "Not found"],
	                "dolby_audio": ["Yes", "No", "Not found"],
	                "description": ["PGM English Stereo Left", "PGM English Stereo Right", "PGM English Mono", "Commentary Clean Language 1 Mono", "Commentary Clean Language 2 Mono", "International Sound Stereo Left", "International Sound Stereo Right", "International Sound MONO", "PGM Language 3 Mono", "PGM Language 4 Mono", "Dolby E Channel A", "Dolby E Channel B", "Not found"],
	                "video_format": ["1080i50", "1080i60", "1080p50", "1080p60", "Not found"]
                }
                The required formats: 
                    Date values should be formatted as dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss. 
                    Frequency values should be formatted in MHz with 6 digits and 3 decimals places (e.g., 123.567 MHz). 
                    Symbol rate should be formatted in MSym/s with 8 decimals.
				Additional information that might help with mapping:
					for Satellites, you will see that the names are often an abbreviation of a Satellite provider (e.g. EUT) followed by numbers and letters (e.g. 7A), we're not interested in the letters so you can map "EUT 7A-7E" for example to "EUT 7"
					polarization is often indicated as X (equivalent to Horizontal) or Y polarization (equivalent to Vertical)
